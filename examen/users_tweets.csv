Is the new season of True Detective as woke as we all assumed it was going to be?
They will continue to vote for all of the same political leaders who explicitly promise to make all of their problems worse while demanding that stores like Walgreens just volunteer to lose revenue by the millions. They will do everything but change their voting habits or take…
Delusional
I have not seen a pro-Haley account on this site, or met a pro-Haley conservative in real life, at any point during this entire campaign season
Columbus's sins, both real and imagined, have been discussed ad nauseam. Everyone has talked about them. They are especially discussed on his holiday, which has all but been replaced at this point. MLK is only just now getting a small piece of what Columbus has gotten for years.…
No. I want every man to be held to the standard he sets for others. That is justice.
We need to start treating people with appropriate amounts of scorn and ridicule for recording this kind of stuff
He asked someone to film him while he helps his wife in the bathroom. I mean the level of narcissism here is off the Richter scale.
This city of Phoenix just allowed something called “No Pants Light Rail Day” to take place. A group of adults rode public transportation in their underwear. Some of them wore fetish gear. Children were present. This is horrific. Every adult involved should be in jail.
It's literally my job https://twitter.com/denimsodapop/status/1746695606943318313
I don't care that Trump attacked Vivek. They're running against each other. This is politics. It is what it is. But if your own professed opinion about Vivek has now changed on a dime because Trump said so, that says a lot more about you than it does about either of those guys.
"If you don't want people to comment on your termination, don't record it and post it on the internet. Also, she's performing for the camera that the other party doesn't know is there. Absolutely nothing ""genuine"" about it."
First of all, don't complain about being a cog in the corporate machine if you went out and got a job as a cog in the corporate machine. Second, she hasn't closed a sale since August. It's not some kind of human rights violation to get fired from a sales job when you aren't…
You love that she recorded this because the self-destruction of her future career prospects doesn’t effect you. But she will not love that she recorded this when no employer ever hires her again after seeing how she secretly records meetings and posts them to social media for…
The secondhand embarrassment is overwhelming
Thank you for this serious analysis of my obviously totally sincere and serious statement, Jennifer
On my show I warned that we’re going to see major airline disasters in the near future. Only a couple of weeks later, a hole blew open in the side of a plane in flight. Now we know that many planes have “loose bolts.” We’re well on our way to a major disaster. Quality and…
Mike DeWine is a pathetic chickenshit coward who should be run out of Republican politics in disgrace. Everyone with a brain knows that castrating and sterilizing children is evil. Even Mike DeWine knows it, no matter what he says.
You could not have possibly used a worse historical analogy to make the point you're trying to make.
He managed to get “you’re” right but then it all fell apart when it came time to spell the word “retarded”
Serious question: when Media Matters takes a clip of me obviously joking around about something and posts it like it was meant to be serious analysis, are the rest of you pretending to not understand that it’s a joke or have you actually sincerely been fooled by Media Matters?
Rule #25 stipulates that none of my rules are arbitrary
Fox News is doing a segment in the year 2024 complaining about Green Day's liberal agenda. Green Day has been a left wing faux-punk band for like 35 years.
We are a society that refuses to accept the reality of aging and it’s getting more embarrassing by the day
I'm guessing gender reassignment
It’s no surprise that mentally ill people who are committing acts of butchery and violence against themselves would wish to turn that violence against others
Absolutely disgusting. Not meant for human consumption.
DEI is destroying the airline industry and lots of people will die because of it:
"This is all totally absurd. The only people who are actually ""underrepresented"" in Hollywood, in comparison to their numbers in the general population, are white men."
"Republicans who use the ""white privilege"" line against Hunter Biden, and conservatives who cheer them on, are all brain dead morons. You are affirming one of the Left's most toxic false narratives in an attempt to own the libs. You aren't. They own you. Hunter Biden has Biden…"
"Flipping the switch at the iconic Empire State Building to the sounds of ""Wrap Me Up"" was a dream come true. A massive thank you to @iHeartRadioand @StateFarm for making this monumental New York moment possible."

Huge thanks to @jonasbrothers for giving me the surprise guest spot on 'The Tour' tour. And thank you to @yankeestadium for turning it into the world’s biggest karaoke party. This is one of those nights I will ever forget.
I’m so proud of everyone for collectively not choosing the Mega Millions lottery numbers 8, 24, 30, 45, 61 and 12. They are ridiculous numbers and we all know it. The best part is that we didn’t even have to ask each other - we just did it… together. And there is strength in…
